# Configuring the applet

You can configure the applet editing the files in `~/.config/cosmic/dev.DBrox.CosmicSystemMonitor/v2/`.

The configuration is divided in 3 files:

- [Components](./Components.md): controls what resource monitors are displayed and how they are viewed
- [Sampling](./Sampling.md): controls the speed of the sampling and how many samples are stored for each of the resources monitored
- [Layout](./Layout.md): controls the padding and spacing of the components
