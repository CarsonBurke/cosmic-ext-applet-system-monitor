# Layout

The layout config determine the applet `padding`, the `spacing` between [components](./Components.md) and the components `inner_spacing` between views.

The value of padding can be either `Suggested` or a number.

## Example
```
(
    padding: Suggested,
    spacing: 5.0,
    inner_spacing: 2.5,
)
```
